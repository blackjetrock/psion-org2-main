Errata for V1.1 of main PCB
===========================

1. 5V regulator being on power PCB means processor PCB isn't stand alone
   any more as Pico is powered from it. Pico can't use battery voltage.
   I think it could be USB powered in stand alone mode. You'd also
   need a battery though for th eother circuitry.
   Or put 5V regulator on processor PCB again?
   Or not have sytand alone any more?
2. R13 should be 10k, due maybe to some leakage across PCB
3. Tracks from R15 to TR2 seems to have leakage on to the gate of TR2,
   causing it to not turn off properly. Changing R13 to 10k and removing
   the track allows TR2 to turn off. re-route track. Chek clearances.
4. R25 has to go to VBAT or there is no voltage to allow the RTC to turn
   on the power
5. 100nF across R13 and R14, and R18. All mosfets.
