V1.0 Psion recreate Main PCB Errata
===================================

1. S_PGM pin needs to be attached for paged datapacks. Not on edge connector.
   Used pin 10 on edge connector.
2. Pin headers don't line up
3. Holes missing for top slot
4. OLED pin 10 should be GND not open.
5. Top row of keys wired up wrong.
6. Mislabelled P52 as p52 on keyboard.
7. Put battery voltage circuit on the 'off' side of ON switch to reduce
   supply current draw when off.
8. Need a diode on each keyboard drive line to allow shiftkey to work.
9. Put jumper in so OLED supply can be hard wired to GND. There's about
   3V loss with switch and display doesn't turn off fully anyway. Switched
   3V3 power allows it to be turned off.
10. Put jumper for MFP output so it can be disabled. It holds
    power on when low.
11. QH_O not attached to shift register
12. Possibly put LEDs on the KB side of the PCB for backlighting
13. Tie unused 245 inputs?
14. Put buck boost regulator on for 5V so can run from USB supply?
15. VBAT should come from after the diodes that connect to the battery
    and the external power connector. Maybe some signals should come
    off the battery and not the diode cathodes?
16. Put space around mounting holes
17. Top slot moulding doesn't fit, move components so it does.
18. AC_B input is wroing polarity. pulling low should turn organiser on.
    Maybe invert logi of keyboard scanning?
19. 22uH inductor needs to move, maybe.
20. C14 and C15 are badly placed
21. Decoupling needed for U2,U4,U5
22. M1,M3 etc need voltage limiting circuits if external power voltage
    isn't limited. Alternatively limit external power to 8V or whatever
    M1 etc can operate with. Or swap those transistors for higher volatge
    rating of Vgs
23. RTC_MFP has battery voltage on it.
24. Battery switching needs to limit Vgs. Power needs to be supported up to
    14V/17V.
25. Buzzer output is OK. maybe a faster drive?
26. Run buzzer drive to power PCB
