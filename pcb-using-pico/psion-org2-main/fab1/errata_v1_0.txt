V1.0 Psion recreate Main PCB Errata
===================================

1. S_PGM pin needs to be attached for paged datapacks. Not on edge connector.
   Used pin 10 on edge connector.
2. Pin headers don't line up
3. Holes missing for top slot
4. OLED pin 10 should be GND not open.
5. Top row of keys wired up wrong.
6. Mislabelled P52 as p52 on keyboard.
7. Put battery voltage circuit on the 'off' side of ON switch to reduce
   supply current draw when off.
8. Need a diode on each keyboard drive line to allow shiftkey to work.
9. Put jumper in so OLED supply can be hard wired to GND. There's about
   3V loss with switch and display doesn't turn off fully anyway. Switched
   3V3 power allows it to be turned off.
10. Put jumper for MFP output so it can be disabled. It holds
    power on when low.
11. QH_O not attached to shift register
