V1.0 Psion recreate Main PCB Errata
===================================

DONE SCH     1. S_PGM pin needs to be attached for paged datapacks. Not on edge connector.
                Used pin 10 on edge connector. *added*
             2. Pin headers don't line up
             3. Holes missing for top slot
DONE SCH     4. OLED pin 10 should be GND not open.
DONE SCH     5. Top row of keys wired up wrong.
DONE SCH     6. Mislabelled P52 as p52 on keyboard.
DONE SCH     7. Put battery voltage circuit on the 'off' side of ON switch to reduce
                supply current draw when off.
DONE SCH     8. Need a diode on each keyboard drive line to allow shiftkey to work.
DONE SCH     9. Put jumper in so OLED supply can be hard wired to GND. There's about
                3V loss with switch and display doesn't turn off fully anyway. Switched
                3V3 power allows it to be turned off. *removed circuit*
DONE SCH     10. Put jumper for MFP output so it can be disabled. It holds
                 power on when low. Added transistor to prevent VBAT on MFP pin. No jumper
		 as we can leave transistor off if the signal isn't needed. Or resistor.
DONE SCH     11. QH_O not attached to shift register
             12. Possibly put LEDs on the KB side of the PCB for backlighting
???          13. Tie unused 245 inputs? *There isn't one on this PCB*
             14. Put buck boost regulator on for 5V so can run from USB supply?
DONE SCH     15. VBAT should come from after the diodes that connect to the battery
                 and the external power connector so we have reverse voltage protection.
		 Maybe some signals should come off the battery and not the diode cathodes?
             16. Put space around mounting holes
             17. Top slot moulding doesn't fit, move components so it does.
***          18. AC_B input is wrong polarity. pulling low should turn organiser on.
                 Maybe invert logic of keyboard scanning? Put inverter on the power PCB
		 as it's related to the power circuit and top slot. Not really for main
		 PCB. Saves space on main PCB.
             19. 22uH inductor needs to move, maybe.
             20. C14 and C15 are badly placed
 DONE SCH    21. Decoupling needed for U2,U4,U5
 DONE SCH    22. M1,M3 etc need voltage limiting circuits if external power voltage
                 isn't limited. Alternatively limit external power to 8V or whatever
                 M1 etc can operate with. Or swap those transistors for higher voltage
                 rating of Vgs
DONE SCH     23. RTC_MFP has battery voltage on it.
DONE SCH     24. Battery switching needs to limit Vgs. Power needs to be supported up to
                 14V/17V.
DONE LEAVE   25. Buzzer output is OK. Maybe a faster drive? Works ok. Emulation a bit
	         slow so tones not as high
DONE SCH     26. Run buzzer drive to power PCB
DONE SCH     27. JP8 and JP9 not needed. ON can be powered from battery voltage.
DONE SCH     28. Remove JP10 as can just jumper the diode.
	     29. Running off 5V would be nice.
	     30. Take 5V regulator for slots off main PCB.
