V1.0 Psion recreate Power PCB Errata
===================================

1. S_PGM pin needs to be attached for paged datapacks.
2. SPGM not on edge connector
3. Put pads on PCB for beeper springs
4. Put buck boost for running off USB supply on this PCB? Maybe better on
   processor PCB? If just for datapacks then power PCB.
   Why is 5V regulator on processor PCB? It powers the slots and they are a power PCB funtion.
5. Pull downs on pack slot connector side of SDx databus lines needed.
6. Switch supply of WROOM with 2 transistor switch from VBAT_SWITCHED2
into 3V3 regulator.
7. Screw post hits U7
8. External power filter/protection?
9. Add connections for programming the WROOM
10. Limit Vgs on mosfets.
11. IO0 to GND for programming mode
    TXD0 and RXD0 to RXD and TXD
